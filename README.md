## My process

The development of the website began with a focus on the desktop version, where I carefully structured and aligned all elements according to the design specifications. Once the desktop layout was finalized, meeting both functional and aesthetic standards, I moved on to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

To achieve responsiveness across different screen sizes, I utilized CSS media queries, which enabled the website to adapt seamlessly without requiring a separate redesign for each device. By fine-tuning the layout, typography, and positioning through these media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience that preserved the original design's look and feel across all platforms.

Key elements of the approach included:

  - Starting with a desktop-first design to prioritize performance and usability on larger screens before adapting to smaller devices.
  - Creating responsive layouts that automatically adjust content and visuals for an intuitive and polished interface on tablets and smartphones.
  - Conducting thorough testing and optimization across various devices and browsers to guarantee cross-platform compatibility and a smooth experience on any device.
